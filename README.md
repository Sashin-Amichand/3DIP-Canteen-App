# 3DIP-Canteen-App
This application is created for Botany Downs Secondary College canteen. This application is used for the students there to order items from the canteen online, rather in person, to help stop the spread of Covid-19. The cafeteria menu/items were acquired from this website: https://www.bdsc.school.nz/our-college/student-care-and-wellbeing/cafe/ .
